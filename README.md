Super Simple Template Library
=============================

## Introduction

This library is a super simple implementation of some useful yet not easy to
do operations on C++. The core objective was building a functor object that
didn't allocate memory to hold pointer to member references. This was
accomplished, despite hatter simple, with the ss::FunctorT class template.

Now we have some others tasks like a set of property like objects and an event
system.
