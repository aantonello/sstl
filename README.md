Super Simple Template Library
=============================

## Introduction

This library is a super simple implementation of some useful yet not easy to
do operations on C++. The core objective was building a functor object that
didn't allocate memory to hold pointer to member references. This was
accomplished, despite in a simple way, with the ss::FunctorT class template.

Now we have some others tasks like a set of property like objects and an event
system.

The set of property like classes was done and is working almost well. There
should be some things to improve but, for now, is enough.

The event system is working well. It is limited in its way but, is enough for
my work.
